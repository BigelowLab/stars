## Scalable, Spatiotemporal Tidy Arrays for R (stars)

### Edzer Pebesma, Etienne Racine, Michael Sumner

Spatiotemporal data often comes in the form of dense arrays,
with space and time being array dimensions. Examples include
socio-economic or demographic data, environmental variables
monitored at fixed stations, time series of satellite images
with multiple spectral bands, spatial simulations, climate model
results. Currently, R does not have infrastructure to handle and
analyse such arrays easily. Package raster is probably still the
most powerful package for handling this kind of data in memory and
on disk, but does not address non-raster time series, rasters time
series with multiple attributes, rasters with mixed type attributes,
or spatially distributed sets of satellite images. This project
will not only deal with these cases, but also extend the "in memory
or on disk" model to that where the data are held remotely in
cloud storage, which is a more feasible option e.g. for satellite
data collected Today. We will implement pipe-based workflows that
are developed and tested on samples before they are evaluated for
complete datasets, and discuss the challenges of visualiasation and
storage in such workflows. This is work in progress, and the talk
will discuss the design stage and hopefully show an early prototype.
